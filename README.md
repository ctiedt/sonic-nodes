# Sonic nodes

Have you ever used Blender shader nodes? They are an excellent way to visualize shader code
and can be used to learn the concepts without learning all the details of a shader language
like GLSL.

This project aims to provide a similar experience for creating sound.

## Examples

The project includes two examples so far.

- [Basic example](examples/basic.rs): How to create a simple node graph
- [Cpal example](examples/cpal.rs): Output sound generated by sonic nodes using [cpal](https://crates.io/crates/cpal)
